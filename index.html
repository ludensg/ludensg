<div class="artist-statement">
    <p>
        &nbsp; &nbsp; As an artist focusing on the act of creation
         as revealed by its own outcomes, Daniel Gandelman <i>(a.k.a. Ludens)</i> is an <strong>intermedia + transmedia artist</strong> that primarily 
         engages in <strong>painting, drawing,</strong> and <strong>sculpture</strong>, as well as film and digital design, but ultimately deals in <i>games</i>
         as a medium for bridging the gaps between extended forms of performance and object-centered art.
        </br> </br>    
        &nbsp; &nbsp; Displaced by both the Venezuelan crisis and the recent pandemic, 
        Gandelman's work is deeply invested in the <strong>construction of contexts for community</strong> in a 
        changing world. A world in which the concept of a geographical border has a progressively diminishing influence on culture.
</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; In this sense, he employs a perspective in which art history is intimately and immediately <strong>participatory</strong>.
That is, instead of seeing it as a field based upon mere investigation in hindsight, his approach understands
art history as a willful construction, and as a constant current of malleable experience.
        For these purposes, his work delves into what he terms <i>the mechanics of art</i>, 
        an examination of the reciprocal relationship between the ephemerality of performance, collective memory,
         and the permanence of physical objects. Through interactions with these <strong>structures of scarcity</strong>, 
         Gandelman takes a pulse on our connection to immortalized versions of past transient moments,
        and, by extension, pursues both an assembling of the present and a nudging of the future.  </br> </br>

        &nbsp; &nbsp; Situating his art within the context of <strong>unfolding narratives</strong> (as opposed to singular isolated moments), 
        and contributing to the exploration of themes of <strong>meaning, belonging, and the momentum of life in the context of shared human ecologies</strong>,
         recurring techniques in Gandelman's practice include; intra- and intertextuality, agency, and
        the synthesis of unrelated concepts through <strong>syncretism</strong>. Also influenced by the broad
        ideas of Complexity Science (emergence, adaptive systems, and complex
          structures), a <strong>background as a Computer Science researcher</strong>
        further informs his work with the introduction of <strong>algorithmic, computational and mathematical thinking, </strong>
           incorporating ideas such as <strong> networks, recursion,</strong> and <strong>infinity.</strong>  </br> </br>

           &nbsp; &nbsp; Gandelman's artistic actions advocate for self-sublimation, 
        aiming to expand the reach of art practice into the deepest corners of 
        private life through creative behavior, experimentation, and unorthodox 
        decision-making. His work's ultimate goal is to engage in an expansion of
        the reach of traditional artistic spaces into unexpected areas, with an aspiration of
        imbuing the deeply ordinary with creative potentials of expression as inherited from artistic traditions. 
    </br> </br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp; He is currently bi-located in <strong>Miami</strong> and <strong>Tallahassee, FL</strong>.
